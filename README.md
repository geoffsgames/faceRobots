Face Robots (working title) is a build your own robot browser game.
It is very much work in progress but what there is so far is playable, with instructions at: https://face-robots.herokuapp.com/
A video (showing an iteration of the game from mid March 2021) is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qobUmCCBkz8

It will ultimately have around 50 unique blocks to build your robot out, all of which will have a qualitively different effect from each other.
It will also be multiplayer (the multiplayer aspect is implemented but I will need to fix lag issues before it goes live).

Currently very much work in progress, I started it years ago but have only been working continually on it for very short bursts of time during that period (which has created challenges as the old code, while I was just starting out with new technologies, is disorganised and not how I would do it now). 
It is as much about keeping myself in touch with programming during times when I've not been in the IT and learning new skills (Socket.io, Node.io and even JavaScript were new to me when I started). 
as it is about anything else.
