# facerobots-game
Author: Geoffrey Neumann 1916 - 1921

* Face Robots (working title) is a build your own robot browser game.
* Playable, with instructions at: https://face-robots.herokuapp.com/
* A video (showing an iteration of the game from mid March 2021) is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qobUmCCBkz8

It will ultimately have around 50 unique blocks to build your robot out, all of which will have a qualitively different effect from each other.
It will also be multiplayer. The multiplayer aspect is implemented - see socEvents.js and index.js but temporarily taken offline due to lag issues.


##################################### SOME DEVELOPMENT NOTES ########################


* Very much work in progress, although I'm taking a break right now to focus on machine learning projects.
* When I started in 2016 (I have been working in a few bursts since then, not continuously) I didn't appreciate that I should pay attention to maintainability especially commenting the way I would a professional project, I didn't expect it to be more than a tiny "hack" project. Also I was completely new to JavaScript and the project was mainly just to teach me JavaScript and not about producing finished code. Hence why this is my most disorganised project, but I am bit by bit working on tidying it.
